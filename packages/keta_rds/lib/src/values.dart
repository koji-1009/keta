/// Normalizes a single driver value of column type [type] to the [DbConn]

/// package:postgres already decodes most of the contract natively: `int2/4/8`
/// arrive as [int], `real`/`double precision` as [double], `boolean` as [bool],
/// `null` as `null` (with the column still present in the row map), and —
/// crucially — `numeric`/`decimal` as [String], so this adapter is the first
/// that can honour the "decimals keep their precision" clause without effort.
/// The shapes that need adjusting here:
///
/// - a **temporal** value (`timestamp`, `timestamptz`, `date`) decodes to a
///   [DateTime]. The contract is ISO 8601 strings, but "ISO 8601" is not one
///   rule for all three — and the driver erases the distinction, handing all
///   three back as `DateTime.utc(...)` (verified in package:postgres
///   binary_codec/text_codec: both tag the value UTC). So [type] disambiguates:
///
///   - `timestamptz` names a real instant, so it is emitted as UTC with a `Z`
///     (`2026-07-17T10:30:00.000Z`) — the honest, unambiguous form. This is
///     also the pre-existing behaviour, preserved deliberately.
///   - `timestamp` (WITHOUT time zone) is a wall-clock reading the database
///     stores with NO zone attached. The driver's UTC tag is a fiction, so we
///     emit it WITHOUT any offset designator (`2026-07-17T10:30:00.000`): the
///     string must not claim a `Z`/`+00:00` the column never carried. The
///     ambiguity is the COLUMN TYPE's, not keta's — a bare `timestamp` genuinely
///     does not know its zone. The fix at the schema level is to use
///     `timestamptz`; keta reports the value as honestly as the column allows
///     and invents nothing. (This is why `toIso8601String()` alone was wrong: on
///     a UTC-tagged DateTime it always appends `Z`, silently upgrading an
///     unzoned reading to a false instant.)
///   - `date` carries no time-of-day at all, so it is emitted as `yyyy-MM-dd`
///     (`2026-07-17`), not the full datetime string `toIso8601String()` would
///     leak (`2026-07-17T00:00:00.000Z`) — a spurious midnight-UTC instant.
///
/// - `bytea` decodes to a [Uint8List]; it is exposed as a fixed-length
///   `List<int>`, matching keta_sqlite's BLOB handling (and, being
///   fixed-length, it rejects mutation rather than silently detaching a view).
///
/// Anything outside the contract (json/jsonb objects, arrays, geometric types)
/// passes through as the driver decoded it — the adapter does not invent a
/// representation the contract does not name.
